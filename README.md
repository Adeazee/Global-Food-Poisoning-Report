##   Project Overview

This project analyzes global food poisoning data to examine trends, severity, and contributing factors across developed and developing countries. The analysis focuses on identifying disparities in food safety outcomes and understanding how infrastructure indicators such as water access, sanitation, and food safety systems influence food poisoning risks.
The final output is an interactive Excel dashboard designed for public health analysis and decision-making.

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset contains country-level food poisoning data across multiple years, combining health outcomes with infrastructure and food safety indicators

Key Variables: 

Country,
Income Group (Developed / Developing),
Year,
Population,
Food Poisoning Cases,
Death Counts,
Hospitalization Counts,
Water Access ,
Sanitation Access ,
Food Safety Index,
Main Pathoge,
Food Source,

Dashboard 1: Food Poisoning Overview

* KPI summary cards
* Yearly trend analysis of food poisoning rates
* prevalance of food poisoning
* Pathogen distribution
* Food poisoning by food source
* Root causes and recommendations

Dashboard 2: Trends & Causes

* KPI summary cards
* Country-level food poisoning comparison
* Hospitalization and death distribution
* Infrastructure indicators (water, sanitation, FSI)

## Key Insights
* Developing countries experience higher food poisoning rates and fatality rates.
* Poor access to clean water and sanitation is strongly associated with worse food poisoning outcomes.
* Meat-based food sources account for the largest share of food poisoning cases.
* Countries with higher Food Safety Index scores show lower mortality and hospitalization rates.

## Recommendations
- Vegetable should be washed properly before consumption
- Meats should be washed properly to eliminate harmful microrg
- Street food vendors should be monitored and regulated by hygiene standard
- Improve access to clean water and sanitations facilities in vulnerable communities
